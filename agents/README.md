# Council Agents

Drop `.md` files here to add council members. They're auto-discovered.

## Adding an Agent

1. Create `YourAgent.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `emoji`, `domain`) and the agent's persona
2. Include a `## Signature Move` section and `## Example Output` section

That's it. The council will include your new agent on the next run.
